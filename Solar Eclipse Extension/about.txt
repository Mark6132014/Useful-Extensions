Solar Eclipse extension!
This is very cool! I know it is useless, but the thing is the animation is awesome. You can see the solar eclipse in every website you go to!
How to display it:
Once you downloaded and added the Solar eclipse extension. You can right click from a website, anywhere. Then click on Solar eclipse, then click on that. And you can see it!
